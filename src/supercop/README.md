This directory contains scripts to convert the code in the "individual"
directories into a structure suitable for testing with the SUPERCOP
benchmarking framework.

Run "./supercop-gen.sh tag" to generate the SUPERCOP structure in the
"out" subdirectory, where "tag" is a name to distinguish these algorithms
from those from other parties; e.g. "rhys".
