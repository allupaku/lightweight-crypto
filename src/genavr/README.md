This directory contains a framework for creating custom compilers for
cryptographic primitives on AVR.  The code generated by this framework
will usually be better than than created by a C compiler because it can
directly optimize at the instruction and register level.

While it is possible to write primitives by hand in assembly, it can be
daunting to keep all the registers and member locations straight in a
human brain.  This framework removes the human error and makes it easier
to generate highly-optimized assembly code for AVR.
